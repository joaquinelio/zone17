# zone17

Reads issue17 progress from [JS spanish tutorial](https://github.com/javascript-tutorial/es.javascript.info/issues/17)

.then makes a list of "abandoned" articles  (taken with no PR).
update: Fewer filters, No reorder. It's a nice view, and easy to filter later.



## Known bugs:

None, I'm perfect.


## Issues 

If article changes its name,
If user changes login name,
articles won't match. So the date won't show right.  Not my fault.  :(

regex misses non allchar usernames like @john-dow.  Not a bug, it's a users fault  :(

same with titles.  Clearly a Ilyas fault too.  :(

I should practice with generators instead of paging...  this would be fun- 

## Future releases: Performance, css, toggle options, user feedback...
Nah.


## About semicolons:

What about it. No need.
It's not Java. With no semicolons the look is cleaner and I have fewer errors.
I just use them when needed: 
To force newline.

`
  ;(a>b)? fa():fb()
`  

JS, the freedom to step on the flowers.
