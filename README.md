# zone17

Reads issue17 from spanish js tutorial 

.then makes a list of "abandoned" articles  (taken with no PR)


Known bugs:
None, I'm perfect.
If article changes its name,
If user changes login name,
articles won't match. So the date won't show right.

Future releases: Performance, css, toggle options, user feedback...
Nah.
