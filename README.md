Reads issue17 progress from [JS spanish tutorial](https://github.com/javascript-tutorial/es.javascript.info/issues/17)

.then makes a list of "abandoned" articles  (taken with no PR)




## Known bugs:

None, I'm perfect.

If article changes its name,

If user changes login name,

articles won't match. So the date won't show right.


Future releases: Performance, css, toggle options, user feedback...

About semicolons:

It's not Java. With no semicolons the look is cleaner and I have fewer errors.
I just use them when needed: To force newline.

;(a>b)? fa():fb()  

JS, the freedom to step on the flowers.
